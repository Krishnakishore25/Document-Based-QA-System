# Document-Based-QA-System
This project is an interactive document-based question answering system that allows users to upload PDF or TXT files and ask questions directly about the content. The system uses OpenAI GPT-3.5 for natural language understanding and FAISS for fast retrieval of relevant text chunks from large documents.
